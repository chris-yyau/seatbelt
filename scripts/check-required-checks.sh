# check-required-checks.sh — verify required-checks.lock matches reality.
#
# Drift surfaces in four places, all of which can silently break merge:
#
#   (a) Lock vs workflow source:  a required check's `name:` (or job key
#       when no name is set) was renamed in a .yml without updating the
#       lock — branch protection still requires the old name, no check
#       posts under that name, PRs hang.
#
#   (b) Lock vs branch protection: lock was updated, branch-protection
#       contexts weren't — server still requires an old or wrong name.
#
#   (c) Lock vs reporting app: a different integration started posting a
#       same-named status, and we didn't notice. Recorded source_app
#       lets us flag spoofing or migration.
#
#   (d) Workflow check-name uniqueness: two workflows post status checks
#       under the same effective name. Branch protection identifies
#       required checks by name only — when names collide, GitHub picks
#       one reporter and ignores the other. Catches accidental rename-
#       collisions, copy-paste duplicates, and matrix template clashes
#       across workflows.
#
# Runtime order: (a) and (d) are local (no API) and run first; (b) and
# (c) require gh API calls and run after. Output labels appear in the
# order they ran — `[a]`, `[d]`, `[b]`, `[c]` — not alphabetically.
# `--local-only` runs (a) and (d) only.
#
# Modes:
#   ./check-required-checks.sh                      # all 4 checks (default)
#   ./check-required-checks.sh --local-only         # skip API calls; runs (a) and (d)
#   ./check-required-checks.sh --strict-remote      # turn (b)/(c) "couldn't verify" into drift
#   ./check-required-checks.sh --owner OWNER --repo REPO
#                                                    # override repo (default
#                                                    # = current git remote)
#
